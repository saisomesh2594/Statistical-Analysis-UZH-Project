# Statistical-Analysis-UZH-Project

This project aims at reproducing the results of published work by Bruggner et. al. on the topic: Automated identification of stratifying signatures in cellular subpopulations. In this work, they have developed Citrus (Cluster Identification, Characterization, and Regression), which aims to identify stratifying sub-populations in flow cytometry datasets. Citrus is available as a R package.

All the materials used during the course of this project are present in this repository.

The original paper, supplementary information, and the fcs data on which this project has been carried out can be found in 'Paper' folder.

The 'Results' folder contain the .Rmd, .md and the .html files, along with other supporting files. It also contains a .Rdata file from which the results presented in this project have been obtained.
